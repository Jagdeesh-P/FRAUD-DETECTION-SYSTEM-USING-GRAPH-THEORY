# FRAUD-DETECTION-SYSTEM-USING-GRAPH-THEORY

The aim of this project is to develop a fraud detection system that
utilizes graph theory to model financial transactions. By
constructing and analyzing graphs representing these
transactions, the system seeks to identify various types of fraud, including identity theft and money laundering. The implementation
will be carried out in Python, leveraging NetworkX for graph
analysis and will be integrated into a Flask web application for an
interactive user interface. 

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Fraud in financial transactions is a growing threat that traditional
methods struggle to detect. This project aims to develop a fraud
detection system using graph theory and machine learning. By
modeling transactions as graphs, the system will identify
anomalies indicative of fraud, such as identity theft and money
laundering. Implemented in Python with NetworkX for graph
analysis , the solution will be integrated into a Flask web
application for real-time interaction and visualization, enhancing
the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection. 

## TECHNICAL STACK:
- Programming Language: Python
- Graph Analysis: NetworkX
- Web Framework: Flask
- Visualization: Matplotlib
- User Interface: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Data Handling: Pandas
- Environment: Virtualenv for environment management
